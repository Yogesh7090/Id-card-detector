# Id-card-detector
Developed a prototype for automated ID card data extraction through a web camera. This project leverages advanced OCR technologies and real-time image processing to efficiently capture, authenticate, and interpret personal information from ID cards, streamlining attendance management with high accuracy and user-friendly features.

**Overview:**  
    The ID Card Detector Tool is designed to streamline and automate the process of tracking the in-time and out-time of individuals using their ID cards. This application leverages advanced image recognition technology to detect and process ID cards, ensuring accurate and efficient attendance management.

    **Features:**
    1. **ID Card Detection:**
        - Utilizes high-precision image recognition algorithms to detect and authenticate ID cards.
        - Supports various types of ID cards to cater to a diverse range of users.

    2. **In-Time and Out-Time Calculation:**
        - Automatically records the in-time when an ID card is scanned upon entry.
        - Similarly, records the out-time when the ID card is scanned upon exit.
        - Provides real-time tracking and updates of attendance records.

    3. **User Interface:**
        - Simple and intuitive interface with three main sections: Home, Detector, and Summary.
        - The Home section provides an overview and instructions for using the tool.
        - The Detector section is where the ID card scanning and processing take place.
        - The Summary section presents detailed reports and analytics on attendance.
